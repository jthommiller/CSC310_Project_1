Project 1 Instructions:

	This project is split into two python files (.py), labled question1 and question2. In question1, the program input should be a list of positive integers of any length. The program will take that list, and using two queues, sort the list using radix sort. The input should be a list separated by a comma and a space between each element in the list that must be sorted. After the list is sorted there will be a prompt on whether or not the program should continue, type in "yes" to continue the program or "no" to terminate the program. 
	In question2, the program will take an equation in post-fix notation (ie. 52+83-*4/) and solve it using a stack data structure. The program will take an equation as a string and solve it. It will then return the answer.
